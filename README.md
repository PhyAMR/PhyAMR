# Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹

## Who am I?
I am a physics student and have recently developed a great interest in data science, data analysis and of course physics. I really like physics, but also the idea of extracting hidden information in data that, although it is there, not everyone can see.

## What you will see?
Since I study physics I will post here a veriety of projects (all of them related to physics or work with data; sometimes both):

* [ ] Physics simulatons
* [ ] Quantum computing
* [ ] Data Science/Analysis
* [ ] Machine learning (and everything that surround this concept)

**Since the profile is knew (and I'm knew into programming), I will change this part when I do a project or learn new things**
